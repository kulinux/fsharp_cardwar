The rules of this card game are quite simple.

* There are two players.
* The cards are all dealt equally to each player.
* Each round, player 1 lays a card down face up at the same time that player 2 lays a card down face up. Whoever has the highest value card, wins both round and takes both cards.
* The winning cards are added to the bottom of the winners deck.
* Aces are high.
* If both cards are of equal value - three cards are dealt from each hand face down and then 1 more face up to war again. the winner takes all the cards. If this ties repeat the process again.
* The player that runs out of cards loses.
